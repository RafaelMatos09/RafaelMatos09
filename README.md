### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rafael, and I'm based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I currently work in IT support, where I help resolve technical issues and provide assistance to users. My passion lies in hardware, and I thoroughly enjoy working with computer components and devices.

#### Education
I'm currently enrolled in Cubos Academy, a tech school with a focus on software development. My primary area of study is backend development, where I'm learning about server-side programming, databases, and APIs. I'm excited about the opportunities this education will open up for me in the world of technology.

#### Goals and Projects
My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in the field of software development. I'm particularly interested in Java, TypeScript, and Angular. I believe these technologies have a significant role to play in the future of web and software development.
